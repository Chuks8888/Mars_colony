This is where the main data structures are held

1. COLONISTS
	They are the main resource, their goal is to expand
and maintain the colony. They can reproduce, educate themselves,
do technological research, as well as work convinience jobs or work
at power plants or all types of mines
Basically without them the colony has no meaning and no driving force.
Therefore they can be bought for a price from Earth or other colonies.

2. COLONY
	It's the thing. It's like a small country that has to be supervised
by someone, it has to buy resources such as food and maintaint peace inside
colony. Remember the goal of this project is to make Mars livable, therefore
the leader has to make good financial decision, carefully chose their faith, 
political system, and chose the corporations it is willing to get financial 
support from. It's best to see the variables and see for yourself how
important it is.

3. CORPORATIONS
	Corporations are paths of some sort that the leader of the colony
may chose to follow. Based on this decision, the colony can gain money, 
access to new technology and etc. However, this does come at a cost.
That being resentment of other corporations which may lead to higher prices
for ceirtan products especially if the corporations are at war. The last part
may seem scary, but for now the war will not appear inside the colony, it will
be only seen on the changes in profits gained from the followed corporations.

4. WORLD
	the wolrd is just the things that are still in thinking or that the
thing fit into the name, such as date. It's save to say 
that this category will be most likely made redundant in the future
